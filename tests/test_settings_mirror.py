"""The per-user settings copy that survives extracting a new package (#421).

A Windows portable package keeps its data in `<app>/data`, so settings.json
lives inside the install directory. Upgrading by extracting the new zip to a
fresh folder started that install with no settings at all -- stems location,
port, compute device, quality and language silently back to defaults, and a
relocated library looking empty.

The desktop shell already restored from a per-user copy in `ensure_workspace`;
nothing had written it since the data directory moved. These cover the write
half.
