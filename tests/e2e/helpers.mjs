// Two things here are load-bearing and were both learned the hard way:
//
// 1. The sidebar renders from the library store, not from /api/jobs. A job that
//    exists on disk but is absent from the store is invisible in the UI, and a
//    test that clicks nothing passes for the wrong reason. seedLibrary writes
//    that store before any script runs.
//
// 2. The desktop and browser download paths genuinely diverge, which is why
//    #335 was invisible in a browser. stubTauri installs a controllable
//    window.__TAURI__ so the desktop branch runs, and so the test decides when
//    an export finishes rather than racing a real one.
