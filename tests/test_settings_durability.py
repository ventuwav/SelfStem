"""Settings must survive a write that does not finish (#509).

`_save()` used to call `write_text`, which truncates first and writes second.
A process that died in between left a file that existed and did not parse, and
`_load()` returned `{}` for it -- indistinguishable from a first run. The next
`set_*()` then persisted a single key over both settings.json and the mirror
that exists to protect it, so a real user lost `port` and `allow_network` from
both copies with only a warning in the log.
