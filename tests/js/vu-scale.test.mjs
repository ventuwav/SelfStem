// How much of a lane meter a real stem actually lights.
//
// The bug this exists to prevent came back as a complaint, not a failure: the
// meters worked, moved with the audio and were simply unreadable, because they
// were linear in amplitude. Nothing could catch that, because nothing asserted
// what fraction of the bar normal playback uses.
//
// So this measures exactly that, against the levels separated stems really sit
// at, and keeps the old linear formula around as the control. A scale that
// leaves the median lane in the bottom tenth of its meter fails here.
