// The pre-filled bug-report URL (notification centre → "Report on GitHub").
//
// Two classes of bug live here and neither is visible by eye:
//
//  1. GitHub issue-form dropdowns prefill only on an EXACT match with an option
//     string. "macOS" instead of "macOS (Apple Silicon)" is silently dropped --
//     the form opens with an empty OS field and nobody notices until a reporter
//     leaves it blank. These strings must track .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
//     bug_report.yml.
//  2. The report must never carry the track title or source URL. That is a
//     product decision (issues are public), and a regression would leak it
//     quietly, once per report, forever.
//
// Run:  node tests/js/report-url.test.mjs
