"""Playlist import: expand a playlist URL into one queued job per track.

Two steps on purpose. Expansion is a network round trip whose result the user
has to agree to -- "this is 47 tracks, still want it?" -- and a single endpoint
would either queue 47 jobs with no warning or make the client re-post a list of
URLs it was handed. The client never supplies the track list: preview and
create both expand server-side, so nothing outside the SSRF allowlist can be
smuggled into the pipeline between the two calls.
