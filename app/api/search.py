"""Search endpoint for the topbar.

Fired while the user types, so the two things that matter are not spending a
round trip when an identical one just happened, and not letting a burst of
typing spawn unbounded work.

  * A short TTL cache absorbs the repeats. Word-boundary triggering means
    "daft", "daft punk", "daft punk around" are three separate queries, and
    backspacing walks straight back through them. A 60 s window turns the
    revisits into cache hits.
  * A semaphore caps how many yt-dlp searches can be in flight. The client
    aborts superseded requests, but an abort does not stop a thread that has
    already started, so the cap is what actually bounds the work.

Neither is a substitute for the client debouncing. Both exist because the
client cannot be trusted to be the only caller.
