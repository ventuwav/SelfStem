"""Moving the stems library to a different folder (#354).

Documents is a sensible default -- the library is the user's work, it belongs
somewhere visible that survives a reinstall -- but on macOS and Windows it is
also the folder most people have syncing to iCloud or OneDrive, and a stem
library is tens of gigabytes nobody agreed to spend on cloud storage.

Changing the location is not just a preference write. The registry lives inside
the stems folder, so leaving the existing library behind would make the app come
back empty with the files stranded. The move is the feature; the setting is
bookkeeping.
