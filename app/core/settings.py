"""Runtime, user-toggleable settings (persisted to disk).

These are read live (unlike the env-var constants in config.py, which are fixed
at startup), so the Settings UI can change them without a restart:

- `allow_network`     — whether SelfStem answers requests from other devices.
- `max_duration_sec`  — longest track accepted for processing.
- `jobs_dir`          — where extracted stems are written (needs a restart).
- `playlist_max_items` — how many tracks one playlist import may queue.
- `video_max_height`  — max video resolution for MP4 export / YouTube pulls.
- `export_sample_rate` — sample rate for exported mixes/regions (WAV/FLAC/MP3).
- `demucs_device`     — compute device for separation: auto | cuda | mps | cpu.
- `separation_quality` — demucs shift-averaging: standard | best (2x slower).
- `cookies_file`      — optional cookies.txt handed to yt-dlp for YouTube.
- `auto_delete_jobs`  — whether finished jobs are deleted after a while (off).
- `auto_delete_days`  — how long they are kept when that is on.

Defaults fall back to the config.py constants (which honor their env vars), so
nothing changes until the user overrides a value.
