# Albrecht-Shanahan key profiles, derived from a corpus of popular music

# b7 high (3.48) and M7 low (0.81) — the opposite of Temperley/Kostka-Payne,
# which were derived from Bach chorales and bias toward harmonic minor's
# leading tone. Pop/rock uses natural minor: the b7 is the diatonic
# seventh and rings out constantly (e.g. open D in "Come As You Are",
# which is in E minor and uses D as the b7). Values rescaled so that the
# tonic weight is ≈5 to match the prior code's magnitude.
