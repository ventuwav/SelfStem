"""Persistent demucs worker (#309).

Run as its own process: `python -m app.pipeline.demucs_worker <device>`.
Loads the model once, then serves jobs one at a time over stdin/stderr --
eliminating the torch import + model load + CUDA kernel warmup cost that
dominated repeated per-job subprocess spawns on GPU (measured 35-42% of the
separate stage on an RTX 3080; see #288/#309). The parent (separate.py)
keeps this process alive across consecutive successful jobs on the same
device and only tears it down on cancel or a genuine failure.

Protocol:
  - Parent writes one JSON line to stdin per job:
      {"source": "<path>", "job_dir": "<path>", "shifts": 1}
  - Normal demucs progress (tqdm, \\r-delimited "NN%" lines) streams to
    stderr exactly as it would from the demucs CLI -- apply_model(progress=
    True) is the same call the CLI itself makes, unchanged from what
    separate.py's reader already parsed from a one-shot subprocess.
  - On completion the worker writes one more stderr line and, only on
    failure, exits:
      "@@DONE@@"                          -- job ok, worker keeps serving
      "@@ERROR@@<json-encoded message>"   -- job failed, worker exits(1)
    A job failure always exits the worker rather than trying to keep
    serving: after an exception mid-inference (OOM-adjacent or not), GPU
    memory / CUDA context state for future jobs isn't something we can
    vouch for, so the parent respawns fresh rather than risk reusing a
    worker in an unknown state. This matches today's behavior, where any
    failure already meant "process is dead, next attempt spawns fresh" --
    the reuse win only applies to the happy path.
  - EOF on stdin (parent closed the pipe) ends the worker's loop cleanly.
  - SELFSTEM_PARENT_PID, if set, arms a watchdog that exits the worker when
    that process disappears. See _watch_parent for why the pipe alone is not
    enough.
