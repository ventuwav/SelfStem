"""Render the click track to audio so it can be included in exports.

Playback synthesises the click in the browser with Web Audio oscillators, which
never reach the server -- the export path is ffmpeg summing stem WAVs. This
module produces an equivalent WAV so the click can be mixed in as one more
ffmpeg input.

The voice is reproduced from `static/js/metronome.js` deliberately literally,
including its exponential gain ramps, because an export that sounds different
from what the user monitored is worse than no export option at all. The two
implementations are pinned together by `tests/test_click_render.py`, which
asserts the rendered peaks land on the same beats the scheduler would use.
