"""Beat and downbeat detection back-ends for the click track.

Two implementations behind one call:

**beat_this** (default) -- a transformer beat/downbeat tracker from the same lab
as madmom, MIT-licensed for both code and published weights. It is here because
librosa's tracker has a systematic, unrecoverable failure on fast music: its
lognormal tempo prior is centred on 120 BPM, so a 180 BPM punk song resolves to
90 and the click plays exactly half-time. Measured on Green Day "Welcome To
Paradise" (librosa 90.0 against a true ~180; beat_this 176.5) and reproduced on
synthetic punk at 176 (librosa 117.5; beat_this 176.5). This is not tunable
away -- widening the prior to catch 180 breaks slow material instead -- and no
quality metric detects it after the fact, because a half-time grid puts a real
drum hit under every single beat and scores 94% confidence.

It also returns *downbeats*, which librosa cannot do at all. That is what lets
the click accent real bar lines instead of counting a fixed four from the top of
the track.

**librosa** -- the fallback. Needs no model download and no network, so it keeps
the feature working on a fresh offline install and on any box where the model
cannot load. Selected automatically in that case; forceable with
SELFSTEM_BEAT_DETECTOR=librosa.

Deliberately *not* madmom: its pretrained models are CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, which
would quietly make an Apache-2.0 project non-commercial for everyone who
installs it. Its DBN post-processor is BSD and model-free, and beat_this can use
it, but doing so needs a git install with an undeclared Cython build step on
three platforms. The interior-gap fill in beatgrid.py recovers what the DBN was
buying us (continuity through drum-free sections) with no dependency at all.
