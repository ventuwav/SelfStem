"""Resolve a playable audio stream for a search result, so it can be auditioned
before committing minutes of separation to it.

The stream cannot be handed to the page directly. The CSP allows `media-src
'self' blob: data:` only, so a googlevideo.com URL in an <audio> tag is blocked,
and widening that would let any injected string in the webview pull media from
anywhere. The bytes are proxied instead, which keeps the CSP where it is and
means the browser never talks to YouTube at all.

Two things make it affordable:

  * Resolving is the expensive half (a real extraction, one to two seconds) and
    the result is stable for hours, so resolved URLs are cached.
  * The proxy forwards Range, so the browser pulls only what it plays. Opening
    a preview costs a few hundred KB, not the whole track.

Only progressive HTTP formats are accepted. HLS would need a manifest rewrite
and a segment proxy, which is a lot of machinery for an audition button.
