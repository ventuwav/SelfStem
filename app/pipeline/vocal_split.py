"""On-demand lead/backing vocal split (#275).

A post-hoc action on an already-"done" job (POST /api/jobs/{id}/vocal-split
in app/api/jobs.py), not part of the main separate/collect pipeline. Runs
UVR-MDX-NET Karaoke 2 (or SELFSTEM_KARAOKE_MODEL's override) on the job's
existing stems/vocals.wav via a fresh subprocess per invocation --
deliberately not a persistent worker like demucs_worker.py, since this is an
occasional user-triggered action, not the hot path every job takes (the
persistent-worker pattern in ml-pipeline.md exists specifically to amortize a
cost every job pays; that reasoning doesn't apply here, #309).
