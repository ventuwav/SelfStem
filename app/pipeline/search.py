"""Search YouTube and SoundCloud for something to import.

The topbar already takes a pasted link. This lets it take a query instead, so
finding a track does not mean leaving SelfStem, finding it in a browser, and
coming back with a URL.

Two things make this cheap enough to run while the user types:

  * Flat extraction. One request returns titles, durations, uploaders and
    thumbnails for the whole page of results, with no per-result round trip.
    Measured at roughly 1.1 s for YouTube and 2.0 s for SoundCloud.
  * Every result is a URL we already know how to validate, so nothing new has
    to be trusted. Results go back through validate_youtube_url /
    validate_playlist_url exactly as playlist entries do (#173), and anything
    that fails is dropped rather than shown.

The SSRF boundary is unchanged. Each search gets the narrowest extractor
allowlist that can serve it, and "generic" stays out of all of them.
