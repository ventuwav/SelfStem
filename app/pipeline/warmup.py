"""Eager model pre-download for the desktop first-boot setup wizard (#275).

Run as `python -m app.pipeline.warmup`. Downloads/caches the four ML
checkpoint families SelfStem uses: Demucs (htdemucs_6s), beat-this,
All-In-One song sections, and the on-demand lead/backing vocal-split karaoke
model. This keeps a user's first real job from paying for them mid-pipeline. Invoked by the Tauri
`warmup_models` command (desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs) as one of the setup
steps; Docker has no equivalent step and keeps the pre-existing
lazy-download-on-first-use behavior (see docs/models.md).

One line per model is printed to stdout so the caller can report per-model
status: "WARMUP_OK <name>" on success, "WARMUP_FAILED <name> <error>" on
failure. A model failing to download here is never fatal to setup -- exactly
like the lazy path it replaces, a missing model degrades only that one
feature (e.g. no beat grid, or the karaoke split unavailable until it can
download later) rather than blocking the app from starting.
