"""Serial import queue.

Jobs used to be started with a bare `asyncio.create_task(run_pipeline(...))` and
then all blocked on `_pipeline_lock` inside the pipeline. That worked, but the
"queue" was invisible: waiting jobs were coroutines parked on a semaphore, with
no list to show the user, no stable position, and no way to cancel one before it
started. This module makes the queue explicit.

Exactly one job runs at a time, and that is a correctness requirement rather
than a tuning choice: `separate.py` keeps a single module-global demucs worker
process and `registry.set_proc` maps a job id onto it, so two concurrent jobs
would interleave requests on one stdin, misattribute progress parsed from one
stderr, and a cancel on either would terminate the worker out from under the
other. The single consumer here is what guarantees that; `_pipeline_lock` stays
in runner.py as a second line of defence for anything calling the pipeline
directly (the tests do).
