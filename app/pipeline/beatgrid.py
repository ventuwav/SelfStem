"""Full-length beat grid extraction.

`analyze.py` estimates a single global BPM from the first 180 s of the source
mix -- fine for a metadata chip, useless for a click track: a fixed period
extrapolated from a truncated, drum-plus-everything-else signal drifts audibly
long before a song ends.

This stage runs *after* separation instead, so it can track beats on the
isolated drums stem over the entire track and persist the actual beat times.
The frontend clicks at those times, so whatever tempo drift the tracker
followed is reproduced exactly rather than approximated.

Output is `stems/beats.json`; failure is non-fatal and simply leaves the click
track unavailable for that job (the endpoint 404s and the UI hides the
control).
