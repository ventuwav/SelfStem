"""On-demand lead/backing vocal split worker (#275).

Run as its own process: `python -m app.pipeline.vocal_split_worker <device>
<vocals_wav> <out_dir>`. Unlike demucs_worker.py, this is **not** persistent --
the split is an occasional, user-triggered action on an already-done job, not
the hot path every job takes, so there is no repeat-model-load cost worth
amortizing (see ml-pipeline.md / #309 for why that reasoning does not apply
here the way it does to Demucs).

Runs UVR-MDX-NET Karaoke 2 (or SELFSTEM_KARAOKE_MODEL's override) via the
`audio-separator` package on an already-isolated vocals stem, producing
lead_vocals.wav + backing_vocals.wav in out_dir.

Protocol, matching demucs_worker.py's contract so the parent's stderr reader
can be reused: writes progress/log lines to stderr, then exactly one of:
  "@@DONE@@"                        -- success, both files written
  "@@ERROR@@<json-encoded message>" -- failure; process exits(1)
