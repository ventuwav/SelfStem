# Build a portable Linux SelfStem package: a single .tar.gz containing the
# Tauri binary plus a self-contained Python runtime (torch + demucs), so the
# user extracts and runs ./SelfStem with no toolchain.
#
# This is the Linux analog of scripts/windows/make-portable.ps1. Like the macOS
# runtime pack (scripts/macos/make-runtime-pack.sh) it bundles a full
# python-build-standalone install — a plain `venv` will not work because the
# desktop shell checks for the stdlib under python/lib/ (python_stdlib_present
# in desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs).
#
# Phase 1 ships the CPU-only variant. FFmpeg is NOT bundled in the tarball (so we
# don't redistribute it); instead the desktop shell downloads a static build on
# first launch into the user data dir, falling back to a system `ffmpeg` on PATH
# when one exists (see ensure_ffmpeg / download_linux_ffmpeg).
#
# Layout produced (so find_repo_root matches its backend/app + python branch):
#   SelfStem-Linux-x64/
#     SelfStem                 # Tauri ELF binary
#     cpu-only                 # marker read by is_cpu_only_package
