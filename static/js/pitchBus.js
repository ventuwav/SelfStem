// audio engines have to agree on that mapping exactly, which is why it lives
// here rather than twice.

 * lane is always the key that lane is actually in, and there is never a second
 * number to add in your head to know what you are hearing.
 *
 * Drums are never transposed, whatever any control says. Resampling a snare
 * does not move it to another key, it makes it a different drum.
 * `pitchable === false` covers the same refusal for a rendered complement lane
 * that still has drums mixed into it.

 * given it, so the SoundTouch stage cannot be built at all -- which is the
 * common case by far, SelfStem hosted on the network and opened from another
 * machine. "Needs Web Audio" sent those people looking for a missing browser
 * feature when Web Audio was working fine and the origin was the problem
 * (#552). Only on an already-secure origin is a genuine worklet failure the
 * remaining explanation.
